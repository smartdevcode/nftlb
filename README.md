# [nftlb](https://www.zevenet.com/knowledge-base/nftlb)
**nftlb** stands for **nftables load balancer**, the next generation linux firewall that will replace iptables is adapted to behave as a complete load balancer and traffic distributor.

nftlb is provided with a JSON API, so you can use your preferred health checker to enable/disable backends or virtual services and automate processes with it.

## Repository Contents
In this repository is included:
- **src/**: main source code files.
- **include/**: include files.
- **tests/**: automated testbed suite with example configuration files and the script *exec_tests.sh* to run all of them.
- **tests/api**: automated testbed suite for API interactionand the script *api_tests.sh* to run all of them.

## Requirements
nftlb depends on:

- **linux-kernel**: Kernel version 4.19 or higher with nftables modules enabled (iptables, ebtables, etc not required).
- **nftables**: nftables package with **libnftables** included and its dependencies (**libgmp**, **libmnl** and **libnftnl**).
- **libev**: Events library for the web service.
- **libjansson**: JSON parser for the API.

## Installation
To build nftlb, just execute:
```
root# autoreconf -fi
root# ./configure
root# make
```
Finally, install it:
```
root# make install
```

Also, [deb packages](https://repology.org/project/nftlb/versions) are available.

## Usage
Check out the command help:
```
# ./nftlb -h
```
Here is the list of options:

**[ -h | --help ]**: Show the command help.<br />
**[ -l &lt;LEVEL&gt; | --log &lt;LEVEL&gt; ]**: The logs will be shown in the syslog file and with this option you can change the loglevel from 0 to 7 (5 by default).<br />
**[ -c &lt;FILE&gt; | --config &lt;FILE&gt; ]**: Initial configuration file, this argument is optional.<br />
**[ -k &lt;KEY&gt; | --key &lt;KEY&gt; ]**: The authentication key for the web service can be set by command line, or automatically generated. If it's automatically generated, it'll be shown by command line.<br />
**[ -e | --exit ]**: This option executes the configuration file into nftables rules and then exit, so the web server won't be available.<br />
**[ -d | --daemon ]**: Run nftlb as a daemon in background.<br />
**[ -6 | --ipv6 ]**: Enable IPv6 support for the web service listening port.<br />
**[ -H &lt;HOST&gt; | --host &lt;HOST&gt; ]**: Set the host for the web service (all interfaces by default).<br />
**[ -P &lt;PORT&gt; | --port &lt;PORT&gt; ]**: Set the TCP port for the web service (5555 by default).<br />
**[ -S | --serial ]**: Serialize nft commands.<br />


Note: In order to use sNAT or dNAT modes, ensure you have activated the ip forwarding option in your system.

### API examples
Once launched nftlb you can manage it through the API.

Virtual service listing.
```
curl -H "Key: <MYKEY>" http://<NFTLB IP>:5555/farms
```
Setup a new virtual service.
```
curl -H "Key: <MYKEY>" -X POST http://<NFTLB IP>:5555/farms -d "@tests/008_snat_ipv4_all_rr.json"
```
Add a new backend into a virtual service.
```
curl -H "Key: <MYKEY>" -X POST http://<NFTLB IP>:5555/farms -d '{"farms" : [ { "name" : "myfarm", "backends" : [ { "name" : "mynewbck", "ip-addr" : "192.168.0.150", "state" : "up" } ] } ] }'
```
Delete a virtual service.
```
curl -H "Key: <MYKEY>" -X DELETE http://<NFTLB IP>:5555/farms/lb01
```
Delete a backend of a virtual service.
```
curl -H "Key: <MYKEY>" -X DELETE http://<NFTLB IP>:5555/farms/lb01/backends/bck1
```
Get the static and dynamic sessions.
```
curl -H "Key: <MYKEY>" -X GET http://<NFTLB IP>:5555/farms/lb01/sessions
```

## How it works

nftlb uses the nftables infrastructure to build virtual services, from user to kernel side. In that regard, the expressions **numgen** (with its **random** and **inc** modes) and **hash** (say **jhash** and **symhash**) allows to distribute traffic among several backends among other properties. More information:

[https://wiki.nftables.org/wiki-nftables/index.php/Load_balancing](https://wiki.nftables.org/wiki-nftables/index.php/Load_balancing)
[https://www.netfilter.org/projects/nftables/manpage.html](https://www.netfilter.org/projects/nftables/manpage.html)

This software creates the required tables named **nftlb** which are exclusive to the nftlb service and should not be managed manually. Ex: ip nftlb, ip6 nftlb, netdev nftlb...

The integration of nftlb with custom firewall rules are possible creating separated tables and playing with chain priorities. More information:
